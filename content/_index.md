## Hey there, I'm Alex! 👨‍💻

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I ramble about tech, productivity, and the occasional life hack. If you're into coding, design, or just making cool things, you're in the right place!

I believe in simplicity, efficiency, and coffee-fueled creativity. ☕
