# Hey there! I'm Piotr

I'm a devops engineer with a love for Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure and Kubernetes once more. I do various `things` and I am the middleman/missing link between developers and infrastructure.

This blog is my personal space to share thoughts, tutorials for starters, lessons learned from working as DevOps/SRE/PE and my coding projects. Expect posts on Kubernetes, CI/CD, IaaC, observability and other tools that keep modern services running, some homelab/self-hosting stuff will be included as well.

Furthermore I'm finally looking to do some real coding - If I code something I can (at least partially) be proud of, expect some insights here.
